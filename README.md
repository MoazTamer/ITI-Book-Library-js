ðŸš€ **New Project Alert!** ðŸš€  

ðŸ“šâœ¨ **My Front-End Web Development Project!** âœ¨ðŸ“š  

As part of my studies at the **Information Technology Institute (ITI),** I developed a **Library Management System**, a CRUD-based web application that allows users to:  

âœ… **Add** books with proper input validation.  
âœ… **Display** data in a dynamically updated table.  
âœ… **Edit** and **delete** books seamlessly.  
âœ… Perform all these operations on the **same page** without reloading, ensuring a **smooth and fast user experience**.  

I built this project using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (ES6)**, implementing **form validation** and handling events dynamically to enhance functionality.  

ðŸŽ¯ **Live Demo:** https://moaztamer.github.io/ITI-Book-Library-js/
ðŸ“‚ **GitHub Repository:** https://github.com/MoazTamer/ITI-Book-Library-js/

ðŸ’¡ **Excited to keep learning and improving my skills!**  
ðŸ’¬ What do you think of the project? Any suggestions for improvement? ðŸš€
