ðŸš€ **New Project Alert!** ðŸš€  


ðŸ“šâœ¨ **My Front-End Web Development Project!** âœ¨ðŸ“š  

As part of my studies at the **Information Technology Institute (ITI)**, I developed a **book management system**, where users can:  
âœ… **Add books** with proper input validation.  
âœ… **Display data** in a dynamically updated table.  
âœ… **Edit and delete books** seamlessly.  

All these operations happen **on the same page** without reloading, ensuring a **smooth and fast user experience**.  
I built this project using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**, implementing **form validation** and handling events dynamically.  

ðŸ’¡ **Excited to keep learning and improving my skills!**  
ðŸ’¬ **What do you think of the project? Any suggestions for improvement?** ðŸš€
